# Object-Detection
Annotating different types of candy and training an object detector to identify each one

I teach an object detector to count different types of candy. I annotated images of candy and fine-tuned an object detector by adapting and modifying a Huggingface tutorial to work with my data.

Data was labelled using LabelStudio. There are 8 different types of candy.
